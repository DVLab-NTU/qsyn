## Introduction
Qsyn is a C++ based growing software system for synthesis, optimization and verification of quantum circuits appearing in quantum computers. Qsyn implements scalable quantum circuits optimization by combining ZX-Calculus and technology mapping.

Qsyn provides an experimental implementation of optimization algorithms and a programming environment for simulation or building similar applications. Future development will focus on enhancing the algorithms, and visualization of ZX-graphs.

## Third party dependencies
* `xtensor`, `xtensor-blas` for tensor calculation
* `tqdm` for progress bar pretty-printing
* `pdflatex` for outputting pdf files

## Getting Started
### Installation
```shell!
git clone https://github.com/ric2k1/qsyn.git
cd qsyn
```
#### Visualization (optional for ZXGDraw)
```shell
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base
```
### System Requirements
* Linux (recommended): `Qsyn` requires `g++-10` and `gfortran-10` to compile. The two compilers should also be on the same version.
* MacOS: `Qsyn` can also be compiled with Apple Clang (which, by default, is what gets called when invoking `g++`) with version 13.1.7 and up. However, note the following caveats:
    * You may need to install `OpenMP` via HomeBrew or MacPort, and link/add the headers and libraries into compiler search path.
    * Due to differences in c++ standard implementation, there might be some deviations in the output of Apple Clang-compiled program from their g++-compiled counterparts.
### Compilation
1. Qsyn depends on `xtensor` and `xtensor-blas`. To install these dependencies, run `configure.sh`, which checks for lacking dependencies and install them automatically. 
	```shell!
	sudo ./configure.sh
	```
2. Then, run `make` to build up the executable.
	```shell!
	make -j16
	```
    or
    ```shell!
	gmake -j16
	```
    if you are on MacOS.
3. If the compilation process ends successfully, you will see
    ```shell!
    > building qsyn...
    ~/qsyn$ _
    ```
4. To delete all intermediate files created in the compilation process, please type
    ```shell!
	make clean
	```

### Run

* After successful compilation, you can call the command-line interface of `Qsyn` where you can execute commands implemented into `Qsyn`.
    
   ```shell!
    ❯ ./qsyn
    DV Lab, NTUEE, Qsyn 0.4.0
    qsyn> 
   ```


* To run the demo program, you can provide a file containing commands. For example:
    ```shell!
    ❯ ./qsyn -f tests/demo/demo/dof/tof_3.dof
    DV Lab, NTUEE, Qsyn 0.4.0
    qsyn> verb 0
    Note: verbose level is set to 0

    qsyn> zxgread benchmark/zx/tof3.zx

    qsyn> zxgs -freduce

    qsyn> zxgp
    Graph 0( 3 inputs, 3 outputs, 17 vertices, 19 edges )

    qsyn> qq -f
    ```

* The same result can be produced by running in the command-line mode:
    ```shell!
    ❯ ./qsyn
    DV Lab, NTUEE, Qsyn 0.4.0
    qsyn> dofile tests/demo/demo/dof/tof_3.dof

    qsyn> verb 0
    Note: verbose level is set to 0

    qsyn> zxgread benchmark/zx/tof3.zx

    qsyn> zxgs -freduce

    qsyn> zxgp
    Graph 0( 3 inputs, 3 outputs, 17 vertices, 19 edges )

    qsyn> qq -f
    ```



### Testing
We have provided some DOFILEs, i.e., a sequence of commands, to serve as functionality checks as well as demonstration of use. DOFILEs are Located under `tests/<section>/<subsection>/dof/`.

* To run a DOFILE and compare the result to the reference, type
    ```shell!
    ./DOFILE.sh <path/to/test> -d
    ```
* To update the reference to a dofile, type
    ```shell!
    ./DOFILE.sh <path/to/test> -up
    ```
* You may also run all DOFILEs by running
    ```bash!
    ./RUN_ALL_TEST.sh
    ```
Notice that if you use Apple Clang to compile `Qsyn`, some of the DOFILEs may produce different results, which is to be expected.
