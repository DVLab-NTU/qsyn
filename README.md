# Qsyn: A Developer-Friendly Quantum Circuit Synthesis Framework for NISQ Era and Beyond

![](https://i.imgur.com/wKg5cQO.jpg)

<!-- ![example branch parameter](https://github.com/DVLab-NTU/qsyn/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml/badge.svg) -->

## Overview

Qsyn is a developer-friendly `C++`-based Quantum Circuit Compilation framework to aid further development in this field. The main contributions of Qsyn are:

- Providing a unified and user-friendly developing environment so researchers and developers can efficiently prototype, implement, and thoroughly evaluate their QCS algorithms with standardized tools, language, and data structures.
- Assisting the developers with a robust and intuitive interface that can access low-level data directly to provide developers with unique insights into the behavior of their algorithms during runtime.
- Inforcing robust quality-assurance practices, such as regression tests, continuous integration-and-continuous delivery (CI/CD) flows, linting, etc. These methodologies ensure that we provide reliable and efficient functionalities and that new features adhere to the same quality we strive for.

Some of the future work for Qsyn includes:

- Improving high-level synthesis: A well-designed high-level synthesis algorithm can yield efficient high-level circuits and adapt to the qubit resource constraint, simplifying the subsequent synthesis steps.
- More flexible gate-level synthesis: We aim to optimize multiple metrics simultaneously and characterize the trade-off between them. Device-aware synthesis strategies are also promising for further compacting the resulting circuits.
- Beyond NISQ devices: Fault-tolerant quantum architectures require decomposing the Clifford+T gate set and introducing new Clifford gate models. Distributed devices are also a common theme for realizing quantum advantage, necessitating
  algorithms targeting specifically for these devices.

## Getting Started

### System Requirements

`qsyn` requires `c++-20` to build. We support compilation with (1) `g++-11` or above or (2) `clang++-16` or above. We regularly perform build tests for the two compilers.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine by running

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DVLab-NTU/qsyn.git
cd qsyn
```

Then, follow the instructions below to install the dependencies and build `qsyn`.

Alternatively, you can try out `qsyn` in a containerized environment by running

```sh
docker run -it --rm dvlab/qsyn:latest
```

if you have Docker installed on your machine.

### Optional Dependencies for Visualization

Visualization functionalities of `qsyn` depend at runtime on the following dependencies. Please refer to the linked pages for installation instructions of these dependencies:

- `qiskit`, `qiskit[visualization]` for drawing quantum circuits
  - Please refer to [this page](https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html)
- `texlive` for drawing ZX-diagrams.
  - For Ubuntu:
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra
    ```
  - Other Platforms: please refer to [this page](https://tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html)

### Compilation

To build `qsyn`, follow the instructions below:

<details>
<summary>For Linux Users</summary>
    
You'll probably need to install `OpenBLAS` and `LAPACK` libraries. For Ubuntu, you can install them by running

```sh
sudo apt install libopenblas-dev
sudo apt install liblapack-dev
```

If you are tech-savvy enough to be using a different Linux distribution, we're confident that you can figure out how to install these libraries ðŸ˜‰

Then, run the following commands to build `qsyn`:

```sh
make -j8
```

which triggers our suggested CMake build process. Alternatively, use `make build-g++` or `make build-clang++` to manually specify the compiler.

</details>

<details>
<summary>For MacOS Users</summary>
    
Since Qsyn uses some C++20 features that are not yet supported by Apple Clang, you'll need to install another compiler yourself. We recommend installing the `llvm` toolchain with the `brew` package manager. 
```sh
brew install llvm
```

After installation, `brew` will guide you to configure your environment to use LLVM `clang++` and its associated libraries.

You would probably want to install `OpenBLAS` by running

```sh
brew install openblas
```

Finally, run the following commands to build `qsyn`:

```sh
make -j8
```

which triggers our suggested CMake build process. Alternatively, use `make build-g++` or `make build-clang++` to manually specify the compiler.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Docker Builds</summary>

You can also build `qsyn` in a containerized environment by running

```sh
make build-docker
```

And run that executable by running

```sh
make run-docker
```

Of course, this requires you to have Docker installed on your machine.

</details>

### Run

- After successful compilation, run `./qsyn` and enter Qsyn's command-line interface:

  ```sh
   ./qsyn
   qsyn v0.7.0 - Copyright Â© 2022-2024, DVLab NTUEE.
   Licensed under Apache 2.0 License. Release build.
   qsyn>
  ```

- To see what commands are available, type `help` in the command-line interface.

  ```sh
  qsyn> help
  ```

- To see the help message of a specific command, type `<command> -h` or `<command> --help`.

  ```sh
  qsyn> qcir read -h
  ```

- You can also let `qsyn` to execute a sequence of commands by passing a script to `qsyn`:

  ```sh
  ./qsyn -v examples/synth.dof
  qsyn v0.7.0 - Copyright Â© 2022-2024, DVLab NTUEE.
  Licensed under Apache 2.0 License. Release build.
  qsyn> qcir read benchmark/SABRE/large/adr4_197.qasm
  # further executing commands...
  ```

  Some example scripts are provided under `examples/`. You can also write your own scripts to automate your workflow.

- `qsyn` also supports reading commands from scripts. For example, we also provided a ZX-calculus-based optimization flow
  by executing the following script in the project folder `examples/zxopt.qsyn`:

  ```sh
  //!ARGS INPUT
  qcir read ${INPUT}
  echo "--- pre-optimization ---"
  qcir print --stat
  // to zx -> full reduction -> extract qcir
  qc2zx; zx optimize --full; zx2qc
  // post-resyn optimization
  qcir optimize
  echo "--- post-optimization ---"
  qcir print --stat
  ```

  To run the commands in the above file, supply the scriptâ€™s file path and arguments after ./qsyn :

  ```sh
  ./qsyn examples/zxopt.qsyn benchmark/SABRE/large/adr4_197.qasm
  ```

  This runs the ZX-calculus-based synthesis on the circuit in `benchmark/SABRE/large/adr4_197.qasm`.

- If you're using `qsyn` for the first time, a config file will be created under `~/.config/qsynrc` and can be used to store your aliases, variables, etc. If you lost this file, you can use the command `create-qsynrc` to recreate it.

- For more options, please refer to the help message of `qsyn` by running

  ```sh
  ./qsyn -h
  ```

### Testing

We have provided some test scripts as integrated tests as well as demonstration of use. These scripts are Located under `tests/<section>/<subsection>/dof/`.

- To run a test script and compare the result to the reference, type

  ```sh
  ./scripts/RUN_TESTS <path/to/test> -d
  ```

- To update the reference to a test script, type

  ```sh
  ./scripts/RUN_TESTS <path/to/test> -u
  ```

- You may also run all test scripts by running

  ```sh
  make test
  ```

- To run test in a containerized environment, run

  ```sh
  make test-docker
  ```

  Notice that if you use a different BLAS or LAPACK implementation to build `qsyn`, be expect that some of the test scripts may produce different results.

## Functionalities

### Software architecture

The core interaction with `qsyn` is facilitated through its command-line interface (CLI), which processes user input, handles command execution, and manages error reporting. Developers can add additional commands and integrate into the CLI. New strategy can be added without compromising to existing data structure, as all modifications are funneled through well-defined public interfaces.

`qsyn` supports real time storage of multiple quantum circuits and intermediate representations by the `<dt>` checkout command. Users can take snapshots at any time in the synthesis process and switch to an arbitrary version of stored data.

This architecture is central to qsynâ€™s flexibility and extensibility. It segregates responsibilities and simplifies command implementations while enhancing its capability as a research tool in quantum circuit synthesis.
